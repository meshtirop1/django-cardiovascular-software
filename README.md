## Introduction

Django Cardiovascular Software is designed to assist in training AI models for cardiovascular research and diagnostics. The software leverages Django for its backend framework, providing a robust and scalable solution for handling data and model training processes.

## Features

- AI model training for cardiovascular data
- User-friendly interface
- Scalable architecture using Django
- Supports various cardiovascular data formats

## Installation

To install and run this software, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meshtirop1/django-cardiovascular-software.git
   cd django-cardiovascular-software
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
   .venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt >>>> 'for this i did not freeze the requirements'
   'i will do it later' or 'you can freeze it and update the requirements.txt of your own '
   ```

4. **Apply migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

1. Log in or register as a user.
2. Upload cardiovascular datasets via the data management module.
3. Train AI models by navigating to the model training section.
4. View results, including model accuracy and detailed performance reports.
5. Export trained models for further use.
